# Brain-Tumor-Classification
This project addresses the global challenge of brain tumors by creating an MRI-based classification system with PyTorch and the TIMM library. It categorizes MRI images into four classes—pituitary tumor, meningioma, glioma, and no tumor—using models like ResNet18, ResNet50, and DenseNet121, supporting more accurate diagnostics.
